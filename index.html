        <h2>A Weekend On The Seine.</h2>
          <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>
          <h4 id="Day 1">Day 1</h4>
            <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking ,<em>la Seine</em>.</p>

          <h4 id="Day 2">Day 2</h4>
            <p>On our second day, we went shopping on ,<em>Avenue des Champs Elysees.</em> Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.<br>
              After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to ,<em>Notre Dame.</em> We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <em>le Louvre.</em></p>

          <h4 id="Day 3">Day 3</h4>
            <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe.</em> It's huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay.</em> Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
